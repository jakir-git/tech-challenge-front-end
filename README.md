## Installation

To set up the project, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakir-git/tech-challenge-front-end.git projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.
